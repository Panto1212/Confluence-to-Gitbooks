As an Outreachy Intern, I intend to use at least 45 hours a week to work
with the timeline and accomplish the tasks at hand which would include
the following;

::: {.confluence-information-macro .confluence-information-macro-note}
[]{.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning
.confluence-information-macro-icon}

::: {.confluence-information-macro-body}
This is a tentative plan that I formulated based on the project
requirements and is therefore subject to change by the Mentors.
