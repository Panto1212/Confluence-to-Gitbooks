# My Contributions

I focused **[my
contributions](https://mifosforge.jira.com/people/5c8a94db18e2bd1da8624c99){.external-link}**
to the Mifos X User Manual on the Organization subsection of the
**[Administration](https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/52592736/Administration)**
section of the manual. The modifications give a general overview of my
vision for the outlook of the documentation as a whole. I checked for
and corrected grammatical errors on most pages and reconstructed
sentences to make them more reader friendly. I also updated most if not
all screenshots on the pages as well as added a few others that I
believe will make the documentation more credible. I unified the layouts
of the pages to make them consistent and added table of contents on the
pages that lacked them. In the spirit of uniformity, I also modified the
headings of each page to have the same heights as well as the same color
which I also intend to extend to other sections of the manual.

In addition to that, I went a step further to add new features of the
Mifos X web app in the documentation. This is true for the **[Manage
Offices](https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/67141727/Manage+Offices)**
and **[Manage
Employees](https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/67141732/Manage+Employees)**
subsections under the Organization. I included the import offices and
import employees features documenting in detail how each functions. I
discovered that it makes it much easier to document content while
testing the product itself which helped me realize that these features
were not included in the first place as I followed every step in the
demo app while modifying the pages. It also enabled me identify certain
issues that i shared with the community. 

My key learning points are that making or modifying documentation
requires patience instead of rushing through a page correcting
grammatical errors. One has to live the experience as a new user of the
app and manual in order to understand how best to present the content
taking into consideration that the product is a world wide service and
therefore the documentation ought to be reader friendly.
